# phpstorm-coding-standards

To apply these configs in your project, follow the steps:

1. In PhpStorm, navigate to `File | Settings Repository`
2. Specify the URL of the repository: `https://github.com/iZapBrasil/phpstorm-coding-standards.git`
3. Click `Overwrite Local`

You can click **Merge** if you want the repository to keep a combination of the remote settings and your local settings. If any conflicts are detected, a dialog will be displayed where you can resolve these conflicts.

Your local settings will be automatically synchronized with the settings stored in the repository each time you perform an **Update Project** or a **Push** operation, or when you close your project or exist PhpStorm.

If you want to disable automatic settings synchronization, navigate to `File | Settings | Settings Repository` and disable the **Auto Sync** option. You will be able to update your settings manually by choosing `VCS | Sync Settings` from the main menu.
